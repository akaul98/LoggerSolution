3. **Check Log Files**  
Log files are created in `LogConsoleApp/Logs/` with names like `log_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`.

## How It Works

- The `Logger` class reads allowed log levels from `Logger.config`.
- Only messages matching allowed levels are logged.
- Log entries are written to both the console and a daily log file.

## Enhancements & Suggestions

1. **Make Config Path Dynamic**  
- Currently, the config path is hardcoded. Use a relative path or configuration provider for portability.

2. **Support for Async Logging**  
- Use async file I/O to avoid blocking the main thread.

3. **Add Log Rotation/Retention**  
- Automatically delete or archive old log files.

4. **Add More Log Destinations**  
- Support logging to databases, event logs, or remote servers.

5. **Improve Error Handling** 
- Add try-catch blocks and handle config/file errors gracefully.

6. **Add Unit Tests**  
- Create tests for logging logic and file operations.

7. **Support Structured Logging**  
- Allow logging of objects or key-value pairs for better log analysis.

8. **Configuration via appsettings.json**  
- Use .NET configuration patterns for easier management.
